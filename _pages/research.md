## 2024.07 - 2024.08 | SLAM Algorithm Learning and Deployment on Mobile Robot

In Professor Yu Zhang's laboratory at the College of Control Science and Engineering, I engaged in the study and deployment of SLAM-related algorithms. I learned trajectory planning and optimization algorithms such as Far Planner and TEB (Timed Elastic Band), while also acquiring fundamental knowledge of ROS (Robot Operating System). Ultimately, I successfully deployed these algorithms on a mecanum-wheel mobile robot, achieving autonomous indoor navigation, trajectory planning, and mapping using LiDAR sensors in laboratory environments.

在控制学院张宇老师实验室，我进行了SLAM相关算法的学习与部署。我学习了Far Planner、TEB等轨迹规划与优化算法，同时掌握了ROS的基本使用。最终，我将这些算法部署在一台舵轮小车上，通过激光雷达实现了实验室室内的自主导航、轨迹规划与建图。

## 2025.03 - Present | Reinforcement Learning-based Humanoid Robot Running Control

Under the guidance of Professor Qiuguo Zhu and senior students Zhicheng Wang and Yiwen Wang at the College of Control Science and Engineering, I have learned fundamental knowledge of neural networks and reinforcement learning. I have completed the environment configuration and local deployment training of open-source models. In the next phase, I will focus on building simulation environments and designing reward functions to advance the research on humanoid robot locomotion control.

在控制学院朱秋国老师及学长王志成、王艺文的指导下，我学习了神经网络、强化学习相关的基础知识，完成了环境配置和开源模型的本地部署训练。下一阶段，我将进行模拟环境的搭建和奖励函数的设置，以推进人形机器人运动控制的研究工作。
