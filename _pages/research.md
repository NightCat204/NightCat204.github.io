## **2024.07 - 2024.08 | Autonomous Navigation System Development**

Under the guidance of  [Prof. Yu Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhangyu/). I developed an autonomous navigation system for a wheeled robot using ROS, implementing LiDAR-based SLAM for mapping and integrating TEB and Far Planner for trajectory optimization. This enabled the robot to navigate and map autonomously in a laboratory setting. The project was a valuable experience, providing me with hands-on skills in the ROS ecosystem, a practical understanding of SLAM and path planning, and important lessons in system integration and real-world debugging.

I am developing running controllers for a humanoid robot using reinforcement learning. My work involves configuring simulation environments, training open-source models, and designing reward functions to achieve stable locomotion. This project has provided me with a foundational understanding of neural networks and reinforcement learning. It has been a valuable experience in applying DRL to a complex robotics problem, significantly improving my practical skills in simulation, algorithm design, and implementation.

As a team member, I contributed to the development of a drone control system integrating Jetson ORIN NX, nxtpx4 flight controller, and optical motion capture for precise odometry. The cascade PID architecture enabled decoupled position, velocity, and angular rate control. I implemented PPO-based reinforcement learning with domain randomization for sim-to-real transfer, achieving complex maneuvers including figure-eight trajectories. This project strengthened my practical skills in embedded systems programming, ROS-based integration, and RL algorithm deployment. It provided valuable experience in balancing computational constraints with real-time performance requirements.
