## **2024.07 - 2024.08 | Autonomous Navigation System Development**

Under the guidance of  [Prof. Yu Zhang](https://person.zju.edu.cn/zhangyu/). I developed an autonomous navigation system for a wheeled robot using ROS, implementing LiDAR-based SLAM for mapping and integrating TEB and Far Planner for trajectory optimization. This enabled the robot to navigate and map autonomously in a laboratory setting. The project was a valuable experience, providing me with hands-on skills in the ROS ecosystem, a practical understanding of SLAM and path planning, and important lessons in system integration and real-world debugging.


## **2025.03 - Present | Humanoid Robot Control with Reinforcement Learning**

I am developing running controllers for a humanoid robot using reinforcement learning. My work involves configuring simulation environments, training open-source models, and designing reward functions to achieve stable locomotion. This project has provided me with a foundational understanding of neural networks and reinforcement learning. It has been a valuable experience in applying DRL to a complex robotics problem, significantly improving my practical skills in simulation, algorithm design, and implementation.
