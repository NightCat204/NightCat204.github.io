## **2023.10 - 2025.08 | RoboMaster Competition: Infantry & Aerial Robot Control Systems**

<img src="/images/project_drone.jpg" alt="RoboMaster Robot" width="300" style="float: right; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

Over two seasons, I led the electrical control development for the Infantry and Aerial robots. My responsibilities spanned from low-level hardware development, including circuit design and soldering, to advanced software implementation. I applied and optimized classical control methods such as PID, LQR, and MPC to meet specific task requirements, achieving high-performance motion control. This experience solidified my programming foundation, cultivated strong problem-solving skills, and deepened my interest in robot control through hands-on system integration and teamwork.

## **2024.03 - 2024.05 | Zhongkong Cup: Autonomous Line-Following Robot**

<img src="/images/project_zhongkongcup.jpg" alt="ZhongkongCup Robot" width="300" style="float: left; margin-right: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

As team leader, I led the development of an autonomous line-following robot. I was primarily responsible for the mechanical design and control algorithm deployment. The robot utilized grayscale sensors for navigation and featured custom-designed mechanisms, including a bucket and robotic arm, to perform object manipulation tasks. This project provided me with practical experience in mechanical modeling and control algorithm implementation. More importantly, it deepened my ability to connect theory with practice and enhanced my sensitivity to identifying potential research topics within real-world engineering challenges.

## **2024.08 - 2024.09 | Vision-Based Waste Sorting Robot**

<img src="/images/project_waste_sorting.jpg" alt="Waste Sorting Robot" width="320" style="float: right; margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 10px;">

In the "Robotics Fundamentals Practice" course, I contributed to developing a mecanum-wheeled sorting robot integrating LiDAR SLAM, stereo depth camera, and OpenCV-based color recognition for autonomous waste classification and transportation. The system utilized pre-built maps for navigation and vision algorithms for object differentiation, delivering items to designated locations. We implemented URDF modeling for Gazebo simulation and established ROS communication architecture for module integration. This project strengthened my practical skills in Linux-based robotics tools including RViz, Gazebo, and Docker. It provided hands-on experience across the complete development cycle from simulation to hardware deployment and real-world debugging.
